This is a quick tool to edit the metadata of audio files without needing to go through apple music. I'm making this to avoid needing to go through apple music to edit the metadata of audio files that I add to my collection. It's based on taglib.

Wave TODOs:
- [x] Build a basic command line parser
- [ ] Use Taglib to build a quick function to edit the name, artists, albums, and album covers of an audio file
- [ ] Maybe in the future have it also be capable of trimming audio files.
